#### [](#mvp---minimum-viable-product)MVP - Minimum Viable Product

Your dom project must meet these requirements:

1.  Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (must be visual and use the DOM not the Console)  
    
2.  Hosted on Github pages  
    
3.  Commits to Github every day  
    
4.  A `README.md` file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc. [Here is a great guide on how to write a readme](https://medium.com/@meakaakka/a-beginners-guide-to-writing-a-kickass-readme-7ac01da88ab3)

#### [](#if-you-build-a-storybr)If you build a story:  

1.  **Must have two Classes and one instance of each class**
    
    *   Example: make a Dog Class and create a Dog named Sam
    *   Example: make a Person Class and create a Person named John
2.  **Story must be controlled by buttons**
3.  **Must use Flexbox**
4.  **Must have a reset button**

#### [](#if-you-build-a-you-game-must-havebr)If you build a you Game must have:  

1.  **Must be a two player game** (either against the computer or against another player)  
    \- Example: Blackjack: A player plays against the dealer. The dealer is the computer - Example: Connect Four: Two players pass the game between themselves to take turns  
      
    
2.  **A win state** - a way for the player to win the game  
    
    *   High score can be considered a win state  
          
        
3.  **A lose state** - a way for the player to lose the game  
    
    *   Example: Blackjack - a player must be able to lose all of their money with losing hands and cannot play if their bankroll is at 0
    *   Example: Connect Four - the other player has won or there are no possible plays left  
          
        
4.  **A way to keep playing if the game is not over**  
      
    
5.  **Multiple rounds to play** - a round must begin, end, and there must be a way to check if the game should continue or the overall game is won or lost  
    \- Example: Blackjack: a player takes turns playing a hand versus a computer - the player's hand can either win, lose or tie the dealer. If the player has enough money in their bankroll they can keep playing. A player must be able to win several rounds and increase their bankroll - Example: Connect Four: two (non-computer) players take turns adding chips to the board. The game will check if a player won or if the board is full and there are no more plays possible. A player gets four chips in a row (vertically or horizontally)- one person wins, one loses, there are no further plays in this case

### [](#stretch-goals-not-mandatory)Stretch Goals (Not Mandatory - Recommended Features)

*   A way to reset the board and play again
*   CSS to give your game a personal and fun style

You will be using GitHub, **not** GitHub Enterprise!

**Do not** begin your project within a class repo.

**Do not** clone your project into a class repo.

1.  After your come up with your project, [make a new Github repo for your project](https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo/). Remember to keep your repo set to public so you can deploy it.
2.  From there, follow the instructions for a Project Site outlined by Github themselves on [github.io](https://pages.github.com/) To get to the correct instructions, select 'Project site' and then 'Start from scratch'

Note: You can create your index.html on Github or you can create it from the terminal (like we've done in class) and push it up, but you will need at least an index.html to deploy your site.

Extra: want your own domain name?

You can also host your Github pages with your own domain name. [Here is a walktrhough from namecheap, one of many domain registrars](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9645/2208/how-do-i-link-my-domain-to-github-pages)
