Who may we Thank? is a two player quiz game that quizzes the players on their knowledge of historic inventors. The quiz game consists of 10 rounds, with 3 question sets making up each round. Player 1 goes first for each question set, regardless of who won the last set or round. At the end of each individual question, the round score is updated for the player that won the round. And at the end of each round, the ovrall score is updated for the player that won the round. Once all 30 questions have been answered correctly, the player with the highest overall score at the end of the game wins.

Players interact with the game by clicking on the answer cards. Correct answers are highlighted in green and incorrect answers are highlighted in red. When the correct answer is selected a popup appears. The popup will always contain a reset game button. While a round is ongoing, the popup will contain a next set button. When a round has completed the new round button will appear. Only the reset game button will appear at the end of the game.
